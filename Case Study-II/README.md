# Air pollution Valencia Case Study-II 

### Case’s Description 
The City Council of Valencia is worried about the bad conditions of the air during the past summer. The City's sustainability team wants to address the issue
but, unfortunately, the city lacks a visual application to allow the team to compare air pollution measurements from distinct stations during August, in order
to take informed actions for limiting traffic in two particular areas of the city: **“Universidad Politécnica”** and **“Pista de Silla”**.

The City's sustainability team hires you, a freelance programmer with experience in web-based environmental applications, to design and implement a web-based 
application such a visual tool.
